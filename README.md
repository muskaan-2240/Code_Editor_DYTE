 # Code_Editor_DYTE
This is a react project in which i have made a code editor .
This is a react project in which i have made a code editor, it has a file explorer section , a live view section where you can see the output of your code simultaneously and the editors are displayed which can be closed if you need to , the data is retained even if the page is refreshed.
 AFter downloading the files you need to make sure that you have react and react -dom in your pc if not the run the following commands in terminal:-
     #npm install react --save
     #npm install react-dom --save
After that you will need to install some more functionalities that are:-
    #npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
    #npm i codemirror react-codemirror2
Now to run the program follow the steps:-
    -> in the terminal direct to this folder using cd 'address'
    -> execute the series of code:-
                   => npm install
                   =>npm init
                   =>npm start
 after following thses steps the proj should open in your browser .    

##Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
